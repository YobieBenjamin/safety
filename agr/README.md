# AGR instruments: the patient and the vitals recorder

The **Independence Principle** (docs/RESEARCH_PROGRAM.md): the safety organism is external, non-transformer and
text-blind. This folder holds the trusted host-side instruments that turn a transformer into a stream of numbers.

- **Patient**: gpt-oss-20b in Apple MLX format (`~/.lmstudio/models/mlx-community/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q8`), 24 layers,
  full next-token distribution available at every step. Runs on the host because MLX needs the Apple GPU.
- **`recorder.py`** (trusted code, reviewed by a human-directed session, never model-written): runs the patient on
  episodes whose answers a computer can verify exactly (multiplication, letter counting, day of week, modular
  exponentiation, addition). Per token it records tier-0 physical signals (latency, effort) and tier-2 substrate
  signals (entropy, top-1 probability, top1-top2 margin). Correctness is computed; **no LLM judges anything**.
  Resumable and deterministic (seeded question set; larger N extends the same prefix).
- **`after_recording.sh`**: snapshots the dataset into each algorithm (`data/episodes.jsonl.gz`) and runs their
  experiments inside the Docker sandbox. **`chain.sh`**: dedicated-machine chain (finish, extend, analyze).
- Timing is a measured signal, so the recorder runs with the worker model unloaded; any concurrent load is logged in
  `data/agr/contention_windows.txt` for sensitivity analysis.

Consumers: YB-0015 (contamination test) and YB-0017 (HPA-axis organism).

## Metabolic vitals (YB-0018): GPU/CPU power
`power.py` streams CPU and GPU power every 100 ms from macOS `powermetrics`, which requires root. Access is granted by
one narrowly scoped sudoers rule allowing **only** `/usr/bin/powermetrics --samplers cpu_power,gpu_power -i 100 -f plist`
without a password (no other arguments, so it cannot write files; no other commands). Verified: any other command or
argument still requires the password. Install on a new machine (the admin runs this themselves; it is a security setting):

    sed "s/__USER__/$USER/" agr/sudoers-safety-powermetrics.template > /tmp/spm && sudo install -m 0440 -o root -g wheel /tmp/spm /etc/sudoers.d/safety-powermetrics && sudo visudo -c

Remove: `sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/safety-powermetrics`. Record with power: `.venv/bin/python agr/recorder.py N MAXT --power`
(writes data/agr/episodes_power.jsonl; power never runs concurrently with a timing-sensitive recording).
