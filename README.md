# AI Safety Algorithm Mine

Net-new AI safety algorithms derived from graph theory, brain science and biological behavior, grounded in *Garbage In, Gospel Out*. Every entry is **coded, compiled, tested against baselines, and documented four ways**: plain English, technical, mathematical, and code. Negative results are kept in the ledger, because a failed hypothesis is information that stops the next run from re-mining it.

```bash
make all                     # compile + test + evaluate every algorithm
./publish.sh                 # verify, commit, push to github.com/YobieBenjamin/safety
python3 miner/mine.py        # agents mine the backlog, then propose new hypotheses, within a token budget
python3 miner/test_miner.py  # offline end-to-end miner test against a mock API (no tokens)
```

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `algorithms/YB-XXXX-*/` | One self-contained algorithm: `src/` (C core + Python), `tests/`, `docs/results.json`, `README.md` |
| `LEDGER.md` | Every attempt and its result, including failures |
| `HYPOTHESES.md` | Backlog the miner draws from; add ideas here |
| `miner/mine.py` | Orchestrator: claim → generate → compile/test in sandbox → repair loop → promote or record failure |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Re-verifies every algorithm on each push |

**Miner settings:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (required), `MINER_DAILY_TOKENS` (default 2,000,000), `MINER_WORKERS` (3), `MINER_MODEL`, `MINER_REPAIRS` (2), `MINER_PUBLISH=1` to auto-push each success. Requires Docker (auto-started on macOS).

## Security model

Model-written code is untrusted. It is compiled and executed **only** inside `sandbox/run.sh`: a Docker container with no network, no Linux capabilities, no privilege escalation, a non-root user, a read-only root filesystem, 3 GB memory / 4 CPU / 256-process caps, and a wall-clock timeout. It sees only the one directory under test. The orchestrator (which holds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and GitHub credentials) runs on the host and never executes generated code; secrets never enter the container. `publish.sh` also verifies inside the sandbox, from a read-only copy, before anything is pushed, and aborts if Docker is unavailable or any test fails. Both fail closed: running on the host requires an explicit `MINER_SANDBOX=host` / `PUBLISH_SANDBOX=host`.

Validated by an adversarial probe (network egress, DNS, writes outside scope, host file access, Docker socket, root escalation, secret leakage, runaway process): all blocked. Results reproduce bit-for-bit between macOS and the Linux sandbox.

## Recursive mining on GitHub

`.github/workflows/mine.yml` runs the miner daily (and on demand from the Actions tab) using the repo secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. When the backlog is empty it proposes new hypotheses from the ledger, capped per run (`MINER_MAX_NEW`). Token efficiency: 1-hour prompt caching of the spec + reference implementation, a cheap-model triage gate before any expensive build, patch-only repairs, trimmed error logs, and price-weighted budget accounting with a hard daily stop.

## Hybrid orchestrator (local-first)

`./mine` brings up the Docker sandbox and the local LLM (LM Studio, gpt-oss-120b) and runs `orchestrator/orchestrate.py`, which routes each stage to the cheapest capable resource: design and review to cloud Claude; the math-heavy C core and algorithm module to cloud Claude when available; tests, experiment harness, repairs and first-draft docs to the local model; all builds and experiments to local sandboxes (8 in parallel). A free static quality gate (duplicate definitions, stub/placeholder markers, `main()` in the C core) runs before every test. Works local-only with no API key, but then nothing is cloud-reviewed. Key from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or macOS Keychain (`anthropic-api-key`). Knobs: `LOCAL_ONLY`, `CLOUD_MODEL`, `CLOUD_DAILY_TOKENS`, `HYP_CONCURRENCY`, `SANDBOX_CONCURRENCY`, `MAX_LOCAL_REPAIRS`, `PUBLISH`, `RESUME`. Logs: `orchestrator/runs/`.

Measured on the M4 Max (128 GB): gpt-oss-120b 66 tok/s single stream, 93 tok/s at 4 concurrent. First local-only attempt at YB-0003 generated design and all code for 0 cloud tokens but failed verification: the local model hallucinated an API, stubbed a function, and mis-derived a closed form (Gini of one active unit among n is (n-1)/n). Hence the quality gate and the cloud routing for core math.

## Migrating to a new machine

`gh repo clone YobieBenjamin/safety && cd safety && ./bootstrap.sh` (add `--models` to download the local LLM). It
installs the pinned environment, checks Docker, LM Studio and credentials, and validates by building and testing every
algorithm in the sandbox. Reference values: `docs/MACHINE_SETUP.md`. Full decision history: `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md`.
Session artifacts (run logs, raw model outputs, failed attempts): `archive/` (refresh with `scripts/archive_session.sh`).
