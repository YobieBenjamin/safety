# Research protocol (Phase D, 2026-09-30)

Rules every experiment follows. Each rule exists because of a specific failure recorded in CORRECTIONS.md.

1. **Pre-register code, not just prose.** Hypotheses, decision rules, the complete analysis code and a dry run are
   committed and pushed before the test data exists; the recording chain waits until GitHub confirms that commit.
   *(F11)*
2. **Fresh test sets are touched once.** Re-running an analysis is allowed only after a crash that produced no visible
   result, and is logged as a deviation. Test sets used by earlier analyses become derivation data. *(YB-0031 crash)*
3. **No number without an artifact.** Every number in a report, the ledger, the history or a blog post comes from a
   committed script and output file. Ad hoc calculations are not cited. *(F21, S3)*
4. **Verify before claiming.** Words like 'verified', 'proved' or 'confirmed' appear only after the check has run and
   its output is committed. *(S2, F7)*
5. **Early-warning claims face mandatory controls.** Monitors are compared at matched (at most 10%) false-alarm rates
   with thresholds re-set in every bootstrap resample, and must beat question-type and length-only baselines, with
   never-answered episodes as a pre-declared sensitivity analysis. *(F1, F2, F5, F8-F10, F16)*
6. **No information from the future.** Features, normalization and checkpoints use only what a real-time monitor
   could know at that moment. *(YB-0032 look-ahead)*
7. **Run alone, and record the environment.** Recordings and timed monitors run with no other heavy job
   (agr/runguard.py refuses to start otherwise; overrides are recorded); every run writes an environment snapshot
   under data/agr/env/. *(S1)*
8. **Telemetry synchronization is tested before every recording.** agr/test_layertap_alignment.py (and the
   per-model variants) must pass; recording chains abort otherwise. *(F4)*
9. **Local verification mirrors CI.** Both run 'make verify': every test, plus the full experiment of each algorithm
   whose code, tests, data or Makefile changed (scripts/changed_algorithms.sh). Placeholder tests must say what they
   are. *(S4, F36)*
10. **Independent audit before major claims.** A separate, read-only session audits the repository blind before a
    result is presented externally; its report is archived unedited in archive/audit/.
11. **Corrections are logged, never silent.** Errors go in CORRECTIONS.md; historical reports keep their text and
    carry a correction banner. Changes to a test's pass criterion are logged too.
12. **One vocabulary.** docs/GLOSSARY.md defines every term; new documents use its accepted names.
